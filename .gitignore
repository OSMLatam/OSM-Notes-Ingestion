# =====================================================
# Test Artifacts and Generated Files
# =====================================================
# The following patterns ensure that test output files,
# generated mock data, and temporary processing files
# are not committed to the repository while preserving
# the actual test fixtures and source code.
#
# Test fixtures (KEEP):
# - tests/fixtures/xml/mockPlanetDump.osn.xml
# - tests/fixtures/sample_data.sql
# - tests/fixtures/special_cases/*.xml
#
# Generated files (IGNORE):
# - tests/output/mock_*.csv
# - tests/output/parallel_parts/
# - tests/output/workflow/
# - Any file with .corrupted.* or .recovery suffix
# Ignore submodule untracked files
