2. ✅ **2025-10-21** - Issue #2: Fix desynchronization between notes and comments
   - Problem: Notes processed successfully but comments failed, causing timestamp gaps
   - Root cause: No transaction batching, no integrity validation, no error handling
   - Solution: Implemented comprehensive transaction batching and integrity validation
   - Files modified:
     • processAPINotes_32_insertNewNotesAndComments.sql (batch processing + integrity validation)
     • processAPINotes_34_updateLastValues.sql (timestamp protection + gap detection)
     • processAPINotes.sh (gap recovery function + proactive monitoring)

2. ✅ **2025-10-21** - Issue #1: Fix foreign key violation in note_comments_text
