Script to run processAPINotes.sh in hybrid mode (real DB, mocked downloads)

This script sets up a hybrid mock environment where:
  - Internet downloads are mocked (aria2c, curl)
  - Database operations use REAL PostgreSQL
  - All processing runs with real database but without internet downloads

The script executes processAPINotes.sh FOUR TIMES:
  1. First execution: Drops base tables, triggering processPlanetNotes.sh --base
  2. Second execution: Base tables exist, uses 5 notes for sequential processing (< 10)
  3. Third execution: Uses 20 notes for parallel processing (>= 10)
  4. Fourth execution: No new notes (empty response) - tests handling of no updates

Usage:
  ./run_processAPINotes_hybrid.sh [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --help, -h     Show this help message

Environment variables:
  LOG_LEVEL      Logging level (TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL)
                 Default: INFO
  CLEAN          Clean temporary files after execution (true/false)
                 Default: false
  DBNAME         Database name (default: osm-notes-test)
  DB_USER        Database user (default: current user)
  DB_HOST        Database host (default: unix socket)
  DB_PORT        Database port (default: 5432)
  DB_PASSWORD    Database password (if required)

Examples:
  # Run with default settings (two executions)
  ./run_processAPINotes_hybrid.sh

  # Run with custom database
  DBNAME=my_test_db DB_USER=postgres ./run_processAPINotes_hybrid.sh

  # Run with debug logging
  LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG ./run_processAPINotes_hybrid.sh

  # Run and clean temporary files
  CLEAN=true ./run_processAPINotes_hybrid.sh
