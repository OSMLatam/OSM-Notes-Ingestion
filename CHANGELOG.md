## [2025-08-07] - XML Validation Enhancement

### Added

- Enhanced XML validation functions for handling large files efficiently
- `__validate_xml_with_enhanced_error_handling`: Main validation function with automatic strategy selection
- `__validate_xml_basic`: Basic XML structure validation without schema
- `__validate_xml_structure_only`: Lightweight structure validation for very large files
- Automatic file size detection and validation strategy selection
- Memory-efficient validation for files > 1GB

### Changed

- Simplified XML validation logic by removing duplicate functions
- Replaced direct `xmllint` calls with enhanced validation functions
- Updated validation strategy based on file size:
  - Small files (< 500MB): Standard validation with schema
  - Large files (500MB - 1GB): Basic validation without schema
  - Very large files (> 1GB): Structure-only validation
- Removed `__validate_xml_in_batches` and `__validate_xml_structure_alternative` functions
- Updated all tests to use new validation functions

### Fixed

- Memory issues with large XML files (> 2GB)
- Out of memory errors during XML validation
- Duplicate validation logic in processPlanet and processAPI flows
- Inconsistent validation behavior across different file sizes

### Removed

- `__validatePlanetNotesXMLFile` (duplicate function)
- `__validateApiNotesXMLFile` (duplicate function)
- `__validate_xml_in_batches` (replaced with enhanced functions)
- `__validate_xml_structure_alternative` (replaced with enhanced functions)

### Testing

- Updated all XML validation tests to use new functions
- Added comprehensive tests for different file sizes
- Updated integration tests for processPlanet and processAPI
- Added performance tests for large file handling
- Updated documentation for XML validation testing
