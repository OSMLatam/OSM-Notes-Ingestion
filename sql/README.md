# SQL Directory

## Overview

The `sql` directory contains all database-related scripts, including table creation, data loading,
and maintenance operations. This directory is essential for setting up and maintaining the
PostgreSQL database that stores OSM notes data.

  - **Optimization**: Checks current country first (95% hit rate when updating boundaries)
  - **Usage**: Called by note insertion procedures and country assignment scripts
  - **Related**: `sql/functionsProcess_30_organizeAreas_2DGrid.sql` (grid setup)

- **`functionsProcess_20_createFunctionToGetCountry_stub.sql`**: Stub version for testing
  - **Purpose**: Simplified version for unit testing without full spatial logic

#### Note Processing Procedures

  - **Usage**: Called by `processAPINotes.sh` for incremental API synchronization

- **`functionsProcess_22_createProcedure_insertNoteComment.sql`**: Insert comment procedure
  - **Purpose**: Inserts a note comment and updates note status if closing
  - **Procedure**:
    `insert_note_comment(note_id, comment_id, created_at, action, user_id, user_name, text, process_id)`
  - **Features**:
    - Updates note status to "closed" if action is "closed"

## Software Components

### Database Schema

- **Base Tables**: Define the core structure for storing OSM notes
- **Partition Tables**: Optimize performance for large datasets
- **Indexes and Constraints**: Ensure data integrity and query performance

### Data Processing

- **Note Processing**: Scripts for loading and processing OSM notes data
- **API Integration**: Scripts for incremental API data synchronization

> **Note:** For ETL scripts, data marts, and staging procedures, see
> [OSM-Notes-Analytics](https://github.com/OSM-Notes/OSM-Notes-Analytics).

### Functions and Procedures

- **Country Resolution**: Automatically associate notes with countries
- **Data Insertion**: Optimized procedures for bulk data loading
- **Validation**: Ensure data quality and consistency

## Usage

These scripts should be executed in the correct order as defined by the processing pipeline. Most
scripts are automatically called by the bash processing scripts in the `bin/` directory.

### Performance Analysis Scripts

The `sql/analysis/` directory contains scripts for validating and analyzing performance
optimizations:

#### `analyze_integrity_verification_performance.sql`

This script compares the performance of optimized vs original integrity verification queries to
validate that optimizations are working correctly.

**Usage:**

```bash
# Execute analysis on your database
psql -d "${DBNAME}" -f sql/analysis/analyze_integrity_verification_performance.sql

# Save results to file
psql -d "${DBNAME}" -f sql/analysis/analyze_integrity_verification_performance.sql > analysis_results.txt
```

**What it does:**

1. **TEST 1**: Analyzes current query plan (validates index usage and efficiency)
2. **TEST 2**: Performance benchmarks (validates execution time meets thresholds)
3. **TEST 3**: Index usage verification (ensures indexes are being used)
4. **TEST 4**: Index statistics (shows index sizes and usage metrics)
5. **TEST 5**: Scalability test (validates performance with larger datasets)

**Expected results:**

- Execution time: < 1ms for 5000 notes, < 10ms for 100000 notes
- Index `notes_country_note_id` should be used (Index Scan, not Seq Scan)
- Query plan should be efficient (minimal buffers, fast execution)

**When to use:**

- After implementing performance optimizations
- To validate that indexes are being used correctly
- To compare query performance before/after changes
- To troubleshoot performance issues

## Dependencies

- PostgreSQL 11+ with PostGIS extension
- Proper database permissions
- Required extensions (btree_gist, etc.)
