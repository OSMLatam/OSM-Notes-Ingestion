# Configuration Directory

## Overview
The `etc` directory contains configuration files and settings for the OSM-Notes-profile system. These files define system parameters, database connections, and operational settings that control how the system behaves.

## Directory Structure

### `/etc/`
Configuration files:
- **`properties.sh`**: Main configuration file with system properties
- **Database settings**: Connection parameters and credentials
- **Processing parameters**: System behavior and performance settings
- **Environment variables**: System-wide configuration variables

## Software Components

### System Configuration
- **Database Connection**: PostgreSQL connection parameters
- **Processing Settings**: Thread counts, timeouts, and limits
- **File Paths**: Directory structures and file locations
- **Logging Configuration**: Log levels and output formats

### Environment Variables
- **Database**: Host, port, username, password, database name
- **Processing**: Thread counts, batch sizes, timeouts
- **Paths**: Input/output directories, temporary file locations
- **Features**: Enable/disable specific system features

### Operational Settings
- **Performance Tuning**: Memory limits, CPU usage, batch processing
- **Error Handling**: Retry logic, error thresholds, notification settings
- **Security**: Access controls, encryption settings, audit logging
- **Monitoring**: Health checks, alerting thresholds, metrics collection

## Usage
Configuration files are loaded by the processing scripts to set up the environment and control system behavior. Changes to these files affect how the system operates and should be made carefully.

## Dependencies
- Bash environment for script execution
- PostgreSQL client tools
- Proper file permissions for secure access
