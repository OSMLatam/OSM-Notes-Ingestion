# Bin Directory

## Overview

The `bin` directory contains all the executable scripts and processing components of the
OSM-Notes-Ingestion system. This is the core operational directory where the main processing logic
resides.

## Directory Structure

### `/bin/process/`

Contains the main data processing scripts:

- **`processPlanetNotes.sh`**: Processes OSM notes from Planet files
- **`processAPINotes.sh`**: Processes OSM notes from API endpoints
- **`updateCountries.sh`**: Updates country data and associations
- **`updateDisputedTerritoriesWMS.sh`**: Refreshes the standalone PostGIS layer
  `disputed_territories_wms` for WMS (not used by ingestion). Schedule monthly in
  cron after `updateCountries.sh`; see `examples/crontab-setup.example`. First deploy:
  run once with `--init`, then use the cron entry without `--init`.

### `/bin/monitor/`

Monitoring and verification scripts:

- **`processCheckPlanetNotes.sh`**: Verifies Planet notes processing
- **`notesCheckVerifier.sh`**: Validates note data integrity

### `/bin/lib/`

Function libraries used by other scripts (not executed directly):

- **`functionsProcess.sh`**: Common processing functions
- **`processAPIFunctions.sh`**: API-specific functions
- **`processPlanetFunctions.sh`**: Planet-specific functions
- **`parallelProcessingFunctions.sh`**: Parallel processing functions
- **`securityFunctions.sh`**: Security and sanitization functions

### `/bin/scripts/`

Utility scripts for data management and maintenance:

- **`generateNoteLocationBackup.sh`**: Generates a CSV backup of note locations (note_id,
  id_country) to speed up subsequent processing runs. The script exports all notes with country
  assignments from the database and creates a compressed ZIP file that can be used as a baseline for
  faster location processing.

### `/bin/cleanupAll.sh`

Database maintenance script for comprehensive cleanup operations:

- **Full cleanup**: Removes all components (base tables, temporary files)
- **Partition-only cleanup**: Removes only partition tables (use `-p` or `--partitions-only` flag)
- **Database**: Configured via `etc/properties.sh` (DBNAME variable, created from
  `etc/properties.sh.example`)

## Software Components

### Data Processing Pipeline

- **Planet Processing**: `bin/process/processPlanetNotes.sh` handles large OSM Planet files
- **API Processing**: `bin/process/processAPINotes.sh` processes real-time API data

> **Note:** ETL, Data Warehouse, and Analytics components have been moved to
> [OSM-Notes-Analytics](https://github.com/OSM-Notes/OSM-Notes-Analytics).

### Monitoring & Maintenance

- **Verification**: `bin/monitor/` scripts ensure data quality
- **Backup Generation**:
  - `bin/scripts/generateNoteLocationBackup.sh` creates CSV backups of note location data for faster
    processing
  - `bin/scripts/exportCountriesBackup.sh` exports country boundaries to GeoJSON
  - `bin/scripts/exportMaritimesBackup.sh` exports maritime boundaries to GeoJSON
- **Cleanup**: `bin/cleanupAll.sh` maintains database performance and cleanup operations (uses
  database configured in `etc/properties.sh`)

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

For complete environment variable documentation, see:

- **`bin/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md`** - All environment variables and their usage

### Entry Points and Parameters

For allowed script entry points and their parameters, see:

- **`bin/ENTRY_POINTS.md`** - Scripts that can be called directly and their usage

## Usage

All scripts in this directory are designed to be run from the project root and require proper
database configuration and dependencies to be installed.

### Quick Start Examples

#### First-Time Setup

Complete initial setup from scratch:

```bash
# 1. Process all historical notes from Planet (takes 1-2 hours)
./bin/process/processPlanetNotes.sh --base

# 2. Load country and maritime boundaries
./bin/process/updateCountries.sh --base

# 3. Verify setup
psql -d osm_notes -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM notes;"
psql -d osm_notes -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM countries;"

# 4. Generate backups for faster future processing
./bin/scripts/generateNoteLocationBackup.sh
./bin/scripts/exportCountriesBackup.sh
./bin/scripts/exportMaritimesBackup.sh
```

#### Production Deployment

Set up automated processing:

```bash
# Add to crontab (crontab -e)
# Process API notes every 15 minutes
*/15 * * * * cd /path/to/OSM-Notes-Ingestion && ./bin/process/processAPINotes.sh >/dev/null 2>&1

# Daily Planet sync (optional, at 2 AM)
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/OSM-Notes-Ingestion && ./bin/process/processPlanetNotes.sh >/dev/null 2>&1

# Weekly boundary updates (Sundays at 3 AM)
0 3 * * 0 cd /path/to/OSM-Notes-Ingestion && ./bin/process/updateCountries.sh >/dev/null 2>&1
```

#### Development and Testing

Run with debug logging and file preservation:

```bash
# Enable debug logging

./bin/process/processAPINotes.sh

# Inspect generated files
LATEST_DIR=$(ls -1rtd /tmp/processAPINotes_* | tail -1)
ls -lh "$LATEST_DIR"
cat "$LATEST_DIR/processAPINotes.log"
```

#### Troubleshooting Mode

Run with maximum verbosity:

```bash
# Enable trace-level logging (most verbose)
export LOG_LEVEL=TRACE

# Enable bash debug mode (shows all commands)
export BASH_DEBUG=true

# Keep all files
export CLEAN=false

# Run script
./bin/process/processAPINotes.sh

[INFO] Database: osm_notes
[WARN] This will remove ALL database components
[INFO] Removing base tables...
[INFO] Removing partition tables...
[INFO] Removing temporary tables...
[INFO] Cleanup completed successfully.
```

**Partitions Only:**

```bash
# Removes only partition tables (safer option)
./bin/cleanupAll.sh -p
# or
./bin/cleanupAll.sh --partitions-only
```

**Expected Output:**

```
[INFO] Starting cleanupAll.sh script
[INFO] Database: osm_notes
[INFO] Removing partition tables only...
[INFO] Cleanup completed successfully.
```

**With Custom Database:**

```bash
# Cleanup specific database
DBNAME=osm_notes_ingestion_test ./bin/cleanupAll.sh
```

**Warning:** This script permanently removes data. Always backup before running!

For **WMS (Web Map Service) layer publication**, see the
[OSM-Notes-WMS](https://github.com/OSM-Notes/OSM-Notes-WMS) repository.

### Generating Backups

#### Note Location Backup

To create or update the note location backup used for faster processing:

```bash
# Generate backup of note locations (note_id, id_country)
./bin/scripts/generateNoteLocationBackup.sh
```

This script:

- Connects to the database and verifies it has notes with country assignments
- Exports all note locations to a CSV file
- Compresses the CSV into a ZIP file
- Stores the result in `data/noteLocation.csv.zip`

The backup file is automatically imported during the location processing phase to avoid
re-calculating countries for notes that already have assignments.

#### Boundaries Backup (Countries and Maritimes)

To create or update boundaries backups used to avoid Overpass downloads:

**Export Country Boundaries:**

```bash
./bin/scripts/exportCountriesBackup.sh
```

**Expected Output:**

```
[INFO] Exporting country boundaries...
[INFO] Querying database for countries...
[INFO] Found 195 countries
[INFO] Exporting to GeoJSON...
[INFO] Writing to data/countries.geojson...
[INFO] Export completed: 195 countries exported
[INFO] File size: 45.2 MB
```

**Export Maritime Boundaries:**

```bash
./bin/scripts/exportMaritimesBackup.sh
```

**Expected Output:**

```
[INFO] Exporting maritime boundaries...
[INFO] Querying database for maritimes...
[INFO] Found 150 maritime boundaries
[INFO] Exporting to GeoJSON...
[INFO] Writing to data/maritimes.geojson...
[INFO] Export completed: 150 maritimes exported
[INFO] File size: 12.8 MB
```

**With Custom Database:**

```bash
DBNAME=osm_notes_ingestion_test ./bin/scripts/exportCountriesBackup.sh
```

**These scripts:**

- Export boundaries from the database to GeoJSON format
- Store results in `data/countries.geojson` and `data/maritimes.geojson`
- Are automatically used by `processPlanet base` and `updateCountries`
- Compare IDs before downloading to avoid unnecessary Overpass API calls

See [Boundaries_Backup.md](../docs/Boundaries_Backup.md) for complete documentation on boundaries
backup functionality.

### Common Use Cases

#### Initial System Setup

Complete setup from scratch:

```bash
# 1. Load all historical notes from Planet (takes 1-2 hours)
./bin/process/processPlanetNotes.sh --base

# 2. Load country and maritime boundaries
./bin/process/updateCountries.sh --base

# 3. Generate backups for faster future processing
./bin/scripts/generateNoteLocationBackup.sh
./bin/scripts/exportCountriesBackup.sh
./bin/scripts/exportMaritimesBackup.sh

# For WMS (Web Map Service) components, see the
# OSM-Notes-WMS repository: https://github.com/OSM-Notes/OSM-Notes-WMS
```

#### Daily Operations

Normal production workflow:

```bash
# API processing runs automatically via cron (every 15 minutes)
# Manual execution if needed:
./bin/process/processAPINotes.sh

# Check processing status
psql -d osm_notes -c "
  SELECT
    COUNT(*) as total_notes,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'open') as open_notes,
    MAX(created_at) as latest_note
  FROM notes;
"

# View latest processing log
tail -f $(ls -1rtd /tmp/processAPINotes_* | tail -1)/processAPINotes.log
```

#### Periodic Maintenance

Weekly or monthly maintenance tasks:

```bash
# Update country boundaries (if boundaries changed in OSM)
./bin/process/updateCountries.sh

# Expected: Downloads only changed boundaries, re-assigns affected notes
# Time: 5-15 minutes

# Sync with latest Planet dump (optional, for complete data)
./bin/process/processPlanetNotes.sh

# Expected: Processes only new notes since last sync
# Time: 30-60 minutes depending on new data volume

# Regenerate backups after significant updates
./bin/scripts/generateNoteLocationBackup.sh
./bin/scripts/exportCountriesBackup.sh
./bin/scripts/exportMaritimesBackup.sh
```

#### Performance Optimization

Adjust processing for your system:

```bash
# Reduce parallel threads if low on memory
export MAX_THREADS=2
./bin/process/processPlanetNotes.sh --base

# Skip validations for faster processing (production only)
export SKIP_XML_VALIDATION=true
export SKIP_CSV_VALIDATION=true
./bin/process/processAPINotes.sh

# Increase Overpass rate limit delay if getting rate limited
export RATE_LIMIT=5
./bin/process/updateCountries.sh
```

#### Data Export and Backup

Export data for analysis or backup:

```bash
# Export all note locations (for faster reprocessing)
./bin/scripts/generateNoteLocationBackup.sh

# Export country boundaries to GeoJSON
./bin/scripts/exportCountriesBackup.sh

# Export maritime boundaries to GeoJSON
./bin/scripts/exportMaritimesBackup.sh

# Verify exports
ls -lh data/*.zip data/*.geojson
```

#### Error Recovery

Recover from failed executions:

```bash
# Check if previous execution failed
ls -la /tmp/processAPINotes_failed_execution

# Review error details
cat /tmp/processAPINotes_failed_execution

# Check logs
LATEST_DIR=$(ls -1rtd /tmp/processAPINotes_* | tail -1)
grep -i error "$LATEST_DIR/processAPINotes.log" | tail -20

# Fix the underlying issue, then remove marker
rm /tmp/processAPINotes_failed_execution

# Re-run (or wait for next cron execution)
./bin/process/processAPINotes.sh
```

#### Testing and Development

Run scripts in test mode:

```bash
# Use test database
export DBNAME=osm_notes_ingestion_test

# Enable debug logging
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# Keep temporary files
export CLEAN=false

# Run with validation enabled
export SKIP_XML_VALIDATION=false
